# Why this project have zero to none structure?
It's the nature of SCP Foundation Russian Branch website. Every file uploaded by the user is contained by the address of `https://files.scpfoundation.net/local--files/ARTICLE-NAME/FILENAME` and there's no way to ever expand it, and a third-party hosting is prohibited for a number of reasons.

# What this project is trying to accomplish?
This project takes inspiration from the card editor by **Mistson** (**Kepchuk**) and **AikenVers** (https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/778601). While the work this people have done is appreciated, this project is abandoned and hasn't got any updates in years. Additionally, some of the functionality (e.g. name of the character) is broken. This project tries to make a new editor with proper functionality.

# Why PixiJS?
PixiJS is a lightweight library which only usage is graphics. Unlike Unity, it allows to make simple application fast and doesn't require user to load lots of unnecessary packages like physics engine. Only graphics - the only thing that's needed for such an application.
